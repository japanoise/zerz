# Zerz - Hellspawn Hex Editor

Zerz is a hex editor, loosely inspired by [hecate.][1] It displays files in
canonical form (one line per paragraph with ASCII to the right) but also
interprets (and allows you to enter) encoded data.

## Future plans

- Search (documented, but not yet implemented)
- Split screens (partial implementation ready; drawing is OK but the interface
  needs work)
- Interpret machine code (6502, z80, intel?)
- Vi keys, better support for CUA/Win keys.

## Name

Zerz is named after the anarchist philosopher [John Zerzan,][2] who doubtless
would not approve ;)
